# 🧩 Framework Mapping

This repository includes mapping exercises, alignment tools, and strategic implementation references for commonly used control frameworks such as **NIST 800-53**, **ISO/IEC 27001**, **SOC 2**, and **COBIT**. These resources support understanding of how different frameworks intersect and how security and compliance initiatives can be structured to meet overlapping requirements.
